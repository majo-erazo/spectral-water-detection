## Hyperspectral references

**Brief description**
This folder contains dark and white references collected with the MV.X hyperspectral camera in ENVI format.Â 
The dark reference is collected with the shutter of the camera closed.
We acquired the white reference using a Zenith polymer diffuse reflectance standard (SphereOptics, Germany), with a 99% reflectance between 350 nm and 1500 nm. We positioned the reflectance standard at the water's height in the flume.

**Reading the data**
The images and references can be opened with the Spectral Python library (https://www.spectralpython.net/).

The "1_Codes folder" contains codes and examples.
