### Information about the dataset
This dataset was collected during a 25-week monitoring campaign designed to evaluate the performance of a novel hyperspectral imaging system compared to state-of-the-art UV/Vis sensors. The dataset consists of 5801 hyperspectral images of raw wastewater taken at a 30-minute resolution, as well as measurements of temperature, ammonium, flow, turbidity, pH, and UV-vis absorbance spectra taken at a 2-minute resolution. In addition, we collected 533 grab samples and analyzed them in the laboratory for conventional pollutants, including ammonium, total suspended solids, total nitrogen, dissolved organic carbon, and phosphates. Notably, we gathered 86 of these samples after four rain events and subsequently analyzed them for twenty organic chemicals, which provided valuable insights into the impact of wet weather on pollutant levels.

### Dataset content
This package consists of 14 archives, including:

 - 1_codes: Python codes for data opening and processing.
 - 2_data: all data collected during the experiment, with relevant metadata, with the exception of the hyperspectral acquisitions provided in separate folders.
 - twelve folders containing hyperspectral acquisitions.
